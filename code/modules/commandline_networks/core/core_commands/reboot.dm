/*
Reboot! This one's piss easy, it JUST tells the node to reboot. that's it. nada. nothing else. doesn't even return anything beyond "Rebooting"
What's the difference between reboot and shutdown? reboot turns it back on, shutdown does NOT. if you shut down someone's heart, you better be VERY
quick to defib it

ditto for like, brains. shutting a brain down kills them.
